# SUIT CSS

CSS for building self-contained, composable, configurable UI components.

SUIT CSS aims to provide a reliable and testable styling solution for
component-oriented approaches to web application development. It provides some
pre-authored utilities and components, but using them is not required.

**[Documentation](doc/README.md)**.

## Installation

It's suggested that you depend on individual packages as and when you need
them, however, you can install the standard library if you prefer.

* [Component(1)](http://github.com/component/component): `component install suitcss/suit`
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/): `npm install suitcss`
* [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install suit`
* [Download](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/releases)

## Features

* Simple methodology. [Read the documentation](doc/README.md).
* Clear relationship between HTML and CSS.
* Scope styles to the component they're intended for.
* Utilities provide structural and component-independent traits.
* Theming support is available via a limited subset of W3C-spec style variables.
* Pick-and-choose pre-rolled utilities and structural components.
* Supporting tools.

## CSS packages

Each package is stand-alone, contains its own documentation and tests, and is
written to follow a common set of [naming
conventions](doc/naming-conventions.md). Dependencies are best managed using
[Component](https://github.com/component/component/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/).

* [base](https://github.com/suitcss/base/): a thin reset for web apps, built on top of normalize.css.
* [theme](https://github.com/suitcss/theme/): SUIT's example theme.
* [utils](https://github.com/suitcss/utils/): all the utility packages.
* [components-arrange](https://github.com/suitcss/components-arrange/): flexbox-like horizontal arrangements.
* [components-button](https://github.com/suitcss/components-button/): robust, structural button styles.
* [components-button-group](https://github.com/suitcss/components-button-group/): a way to group button components.
* [components-flex-embed](https://github.com/suitcss/components-flex-embed/): aspect-ratios for embeds.
* [components-grid](https://github.com/suitcss/components-grid/): a grid foundation.
* [components-test](https://github.com/suitcss/components-test/): structure for visual tests.

You can also download pre-built bundles to try things out without setting up a
build process:

* [base bundle](https://github.com/suitcss/base/releases)
* [utils bundle](https://github.com/suitcss/utils/releases)
* [suit bundle](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/releases)
